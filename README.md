# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes based on various medical attributes. The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains several diagnostic measurements and the corresponding diagnosis (whether the patient has diabetes or not).

The project is structured as a series of exercises focusing on different machine learning models, including Decision Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Exercise 1: Decision Tree Classifier

The goal is to build and evaluate a Decision Tree model to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.
The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of the Decision Tree is provided to understand the decision-making process of the model.
Exercise 2: Naive Bayes Classifier

This exercise involves building and evaluating a Naive Bayes model for the same classification task.
The model is compared with the Decision Tree model in terms of performance metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) where 1 represents diabetes
